# Unity Built-in Lighting Project

A hands-on project created to explore and understand how **lighting works in Unity** using the **Built-in Render Pipeline**.

## 🔆 What I Learned

### 🌞 Lighting Basics  
`Directional Light` `Sky Settings` `Skybox` `Ambient Lighting` `Point Light` `Spot Light` `Cookies` `Halo` `Lens Flares` `Projectors` `Baked Lighting` `Baked Area Light` `Reflection Probes` `Light Probes` `Post Processing`

### 🎨 Color Theory  
`Monochromatic` `Complementary` `Split Complementary` `Triadic` `Tetradic` `Analogous`

## 🏠 Final Practice  
Applied all the lighting concepts to set up and light a **small 3D model of a vintage club room** using the **Built-in Renderer**.

This project helped me develop both technical and artistic lighting skills in Unity, blending practical lighting setup with a solid understanding of color theory.
